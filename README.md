# COVID Illumina Snakemake Pipeline
A pipeline to facilitate genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, adopted by the several labs in SAViD. The starting point is a collection of raw Illumina short reads; the end point is a collection of QC files, consensus genome(s), variant calls, and various QC metrics.

Author: Dr Charles Foster

# Starting out
To begin with, clone this github repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/charlesfoster/covid-illumina-snakemake.git

cd covid-illumina-snakemake
```

Next, install dependencies using `conda`:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Pro tip: if you install `mamba`, yo ucan create the environment with that command instead of `conda`. A lot of `conda` headaches go away: it's a much faster drop-in replacement for `conda`.

```
conda install mamba
mamba env create -f environment.yml
```

Finally, install the pipeline correctly with:

```
pip install .
```

Other requirements:
* Lineages are typed using `pangolin`. Accordingly, `pangolin` needs to be installed according to instructions at https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin.

# Usage
The environment with all necessary tools is installed as '`CIS`' for brevity. The environment should first be activated:

```
conda activate CIS
```

Then, to run the pipeline, it's as simple as:

```
CIS <directory_with_reads>
```

where <directory_with_reads> should be replaced with the full path to a directory with sequencing reads taken off an Illumina machine.

The program assumes that reads are named exactly as they are after coming off a MiSeq/iSeq, i.e. `*_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz`. This unique suffix allows the correct sample names and corresponding forward and reverse reads files to be identified. However, if you have renamed your reads files, you need to provide a suffix via `--suffix` that allows the correct samples to be identified.

Consider the situation where you have renamed your files like so: `sample1_R1.fq.gz`, `sample1_R2.fq.gz`, `sample2_R1.fq.gz`, and `sample2_R2.fq.gz`, and they're in `/home/user/reads`. Now, you will need to run the program with these minimal options:

```
CIS --suffix "_R1.fq.gz" /home/user/reads
```

The program will determine that your forward and reverse reads are in `/home/user/reads`, and that your sample names are 'sample1' and 'sample2'.

By default, the program assumes that you have used the 'Midnight' amplicon protocol. You can specify a different scheme using the `-s` (`--scheme`) option.

All other options are as follows, and can be accessed with `CIS --help`:

```

# Initial QC
The initial QC is done with `fastp` (https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/). View the `fastp` repository for a full list of what the program can do. In this pipeline we leverage `fastp` to:
1. filter out bad reads (reads with too many bases below a quality threshold)
2. cut sequencing adapters, with adapter sequences automatically detected via overlap analysis of PE data
3. correct mismatched base pairs in overlapped regions of paired end reads, if one base is with high quality while the other is with ultra low quality
4. report results in JSON format for further interpreting.
5. visualize quality control and filtering results in a single HTML page (like FASTQC but faster and more informative).

# Read mapping
Reads are mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome with `bwa mem`.

# Processing of mapped reads
The `ivar` suite of tools is used to remove primers from the mapped reads, and carry out quality trimming. Since quality trimming is already carried out by `fastp`, this is a second "line of defence" and might be superflous. After testing, the quality trimming option in `ivar` might be disabled.

# Assess coverage
The coverage for each base in the SAS-CoV-2 genome is calculated with `bedtools`, and then plotted in R. The coverage for each amplicon within the bed file specifying primer coordinates is also plotted (but not for the Swift protocol since it has too many amplicons).

# Variant calling
Variants are called using `ivar`.

# SNP annotation
SNPs are annotated using `snpEff`, giving information including the Ts:Tv ratio, and any functional consequences of the SNPs.

# Generate consensus genome
A consensus genome is generated for each sample using `samtools mpileup` +  `ivar`

# Pangolin lineage assignment
Newly generated consensus genomes from `ivar` are assigned to Pangolin lineages using `pangolin`.

# Summary statistics
A `.csv` file with quality control summary statistics is printed to the results directory.

# Explanation of output files
Results for each sample will be placed in their own directory. There are also logical subdirectories containing the results of each specific analysis.
